# mpp-hats

This script allows the use of hats on [MPP](https://mppclone.com).

Anyone else who has the script can see your hat.

## Installation

All you have to do is click "Install" and the script will be installed.

A [userscript manager](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) is required to use this script.

This script is only supported on [MPPClone](https://mppclone.com) and [the .org domain](https://www.multiplayerpiano.org) to protest advertising on the .com domain.
